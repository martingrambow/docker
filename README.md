# Is it Safe to Dockerize my Database Benchmark?

Docker seems to be an attractive solution for cloud database benchmarking as it simplifies the setup process through pre-built images that are portable and simple to maintain. However, the usage of Docker for benchmarking is only valid if there is no effect on measurement results. This code and results evaluate indirect effects of dockerization on the results of database benchmarking.
